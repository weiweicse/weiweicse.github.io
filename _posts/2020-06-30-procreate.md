Recently finished reading [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692). One point that stuck with me from the book is the concept of [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology). Flow state generally means more happiness (people will want to continue doing what they are working on and forget about eating and drinking) together with more achievement (hyperfocus yields higher productivity). Finding
things that I can enter flow state is one area I am focusing on. Entering flow state with debugging, coding, playing games is relatively easy for me. However I want to develop more hobbies.

Since youtube started recommended a lot of procreate videos recently, I decided to learn to create things with procreate app. Luckily, it's relatively easy to enter flow state for me with drawing, maybe it is challenging enough and my skill is at a level where I enjoy my work! (sweet spot!)

Here are drawings from last week, enjoy!
