After realizing the fact that previous posts doesn't confer valuable
contents, I decided to give a point of view to my blog: explaining
seemingly sophisticated things in a simple way. The reason why it
becomes my focus is partly because of this quote:

> If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. -
> Albert Eistein.

I will try to explain algorithms, difficult concepts, programming
skills in my blog. Please stay tuned.
