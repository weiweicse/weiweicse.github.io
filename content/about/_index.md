Hi all,

I am Wei, an engineer working on Instagram ads. I got a degree in MSCS at Stanford and got my bachelor in Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I believe in 1% rule and hope to improve myself everyday. I will cover my improvements here and keep track of my progress. Stay tuned.

I haven't decided whether to write English fully for this blog yet. So please expect some occassional Chinese posts here.

我是魏炜，Instagram ads的一名工程师。之前有幸在Stanford，上海交大学习。

这里的内容会覆盖我编程学习的经历，职业成长的反思，生活琐事等等。争取自己每天能进步一点点！

技术上的分享会用英文，读书笔记感悟一类的东西会用中文写。
