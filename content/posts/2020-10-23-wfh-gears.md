Have been working from home for quite a long time. Documenting purchases I enjoyed for WFH purposes.

## Desk Shelves & Laptop Risers

Based on my limited research, [Grovemade](https://grovemade.com) has the best design for workspace. Their desk shelf, and laptop raiser helps me organize my desk better and helped keep my desk space clean and less cluttered.

I particularly enjoy this [desk shelf](https://grovemade.com/product/wood-desk-shelf/?initial=342) and [laptop riser](https://grovemade.com/laptop-riser/). Desk shelf helps raise my monitor higher which improves ergonomics. Since my webcam is pretty high, laptop riser makes me appear to be looking right into the webcam while I am looking at the screen.


## Screenbar LED Light

[BenQ Screenbar](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076VNFZJG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is my new favorite for desktop lights. It doesn't cause any glares on the screen and its light doesn't directly go into my eyes. It powers up whenever my screen is powered up.


## Microphone

I've tried multiple set-ups of microphones. At the beginning, I was a big fan of [Facebook portal](https://portal.facebook.com/products/portal/) for all video conferencing. It is really convenient to use, and has very good integration with workplace, however, there are several things I don't enjoy:

1. Screen sharing are painful. Screen is too small to view and also difficult to share my screen on my laptop.
2. Microphone quality is ok but not impressed with it.
3. Echo cancellation is not perfect. Need to wear a headphone to avoid echo.


In addition to Facebook portal, I've tried
1. [Airpods Pro](https://www.apple.com/airpods/?afid=p238%7CsoEw2Fca6-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_427418703272_pgrid_85797749898_&cid=aos-us-kwgo---slid---product-)
2. [Sony WH-1000XM3](https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm3)
3. [Bose NC 700](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/noise-cancelling-headphones-700.html#v=noise_cancelling_headphones_700_triple_midnight)
4. [Apogee HypeMic](https://apogeedigital.com/products/hypemic)
5. [Bose MIE2i](https://www.bose.com/en_us/support/products/bose_headphones_support/bose_in_ear_headphones_support/mie2i_headset.html)
6. Macbook's built-in microphone

> All my reviews are subjective. [Recordings are available in soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/wei-wei-323266803/sets/microphone-test/s-QAvSQVWEH7Z). Would definitely encourage you to records (easiest way is through quicktime player) to pick the mic that suits your need most.

My evaluation is based on 1) recording quality, ~~2) how loud is the microphone~~. Noise cancellation is not needed for me because my room is generally quiet. If noise cancellation is my top concern, I might actually enjoy Bose more. **Update: video conferencing adjusts microphone volume automatically so 2) is not that relevant.**

Based on my evaluation strategy, my relative ranking for those microphones are: Apogee HypeMic > Airpods Pro ~ Bose 700 > Bose MIE2i > Macbook Built-in Mic >> Sony WH-1000XM3. (I invited another tester to rate these microphones, ranking is similar, only difference is how we rank Macbook's Built-in Mic)

Though [Sony WH-1000XM3](https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm3) receives very good review in terms of sound quality, noise cancellation, its mic quality is pretty bad and I am strongly against using it as microphone. It lacks clarity, volume sometimes is big sometimes is small.

Macbook's built-in mic surprised me with the sound quality. However, to use the mic, you need to have a bluetooth pairing to avoid echo. Since it is an omni-directional mic, it will pick up noises from all directions.

Bose MIE2i is a wired earphone, it picks up sound pretty well and with same volume, I can hear Bose MIE2i far better than Bose NC 700. However, noise level when I am not speaking is the biggest among what I've tested, hence the relatively low ranking.

Recording quality wise, I found Bose 700 and Airpods Pro are quite similar. However, somehow, I find Airpods Pro more comfortable to use during VC, maybe because of its better transparency mode.

Finally, comes the winner: Apogee HypeMic. This is definitely an impulsive buy for me but it has been a good investment.
- It has cardioid pickup pattern, so it picks up my voice more than other random noise.
- I am amazed by the recording quality, compression also adds some nice touch to my voice.
- It is also the loudest among all mics I've owned.
- It is wired so no need to worry about all the bluetooth connection issues.

## Webcam

Macbook's camera doesn't give very good video quality and sometimes it is pretty annoying to use with an external monitor. Easiest way to upgrade the whole experience is through a webcam. [Logitech 4K Pro Magnetic Webcam](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HMUC2ZM/A/logitech-4k-pro-magnetic-webcam-for-pro-display-xdr?afid=p238%7Cs4Sv2ChHP-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_246387002832_pgrid_54584529771_&cid=aos-us-kwgo-pla-btb-3pp--slid---product-HMUC2ZM/A) + a tripod works pretty well for me. One thing to remember still is lighting is absolutely important. Having natural light or having some lights pointing to your face will help with video quality as well.


## Beyond Gears

Hardware is not the only way to enhance WFH experiences. Some software may greatly improve quality of life too. I don't use it regularly but it may be helpful to you:

1. [Krisp](https://krisp.ai) is a AI software that can filter out noises really well, I don't have a lot of noises at my home, so I haven't used it significantly. What amazes me most is its ability to filter out keyboard noises. You can leave your mic on while typing and others won't hear a thing. However, I found myself still trusting mute button more so this feature alone is not enough to retain me.
2. [OBS](https://obsproject.com) can be used as a virtual camera, you can post GIFs, text inside your screen with a few clicks to communicate with others. It is a really fun way to communicate with others. However, one thing I don't like is it increases CPU usage quite significantly and it causes fan noises so I haven't used it a lot.
