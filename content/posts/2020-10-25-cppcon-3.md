## Templates

Generic Programming:
- A method to implement algorithms and data structures in the most general sensisble way.
- Algorithms are written in terms of types to-be-specified-later.
- It helps us to reduce redundancy and programming effort, while it increases reusability and flexibility.

Templates: each instantiation for a new type or value results in additional code.
- Function-templates
- Class-templates
- Variable-templates

```cpp
template<typename T, size_t N>
constexpr auto Size(const T (&)[N]) { // Check http://www.cplusplus.com/articles/D4SGz8AR/ for why we need &.
    return N;
}

// function templates.
template<typename T>
T min(const T& a, const T& b) {
    return (a < b) ? a : b;
}

// Specialization
template<typename T>
bool equal(const T& a, const T& b) {
    return a == b;
}

template<>
bool equal(const double& a, const double& b) {
    return std::abs(a - b) < 0.00001;
}
```

### Class Templates

```cpp
// Class temlpates
template<typename T, size_t SIZE>
struct Array {
    T* data();
    const T* data() const {
        return std::addressof(mData[0]);
    }
    constexpr size_t size() const { return SIZE; }
    T* begin() { return data(); }
    T* end() { return data() + size(); }
    T& operator[](size_t idx) { return mData[idx]; }
    T mData[SIZE];
}

template<typename T, size_t SIZE>
T* Array<T, SIZE>::data() {
    return std::addressof(mData[0]);
}

void Main() {
    Array<int, 2> ai{3, 5};  // Why does list initialization work here? Struct + public mData field.
    Array<double, 2> ad{2.0};
}
```

Notes:
- `Array<int, 2>` will have an instantiation of template, `Array<double, 2>` will have another instantiation of template.
- Given there is no usage, function will only be declared but not defined. 

## The Structure of a Program

[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KoXeegncrs)

Overview:

1. Process of building a program
2. Translation unit.
3. Phases of translation.
4. Declarations, defintions, linkage.
5. The one-definition rule (ODR).
6. Storage duration.
7. ABIs and name-mangling.
8. Linking and loading.

### Process of Building A Program

![Process of Building a Program](/images/build-executable.jpg)

### Translation Unit

A translation unit is defined as
- A source file
- plus `#include` directive
- minus any source lines skipped by `#ifdef`

### Phases Translation

9 stages of translation: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/translation_phases.

### Declarations, Definition, Linkage

A **declaration** introduces one or more names into a translation unit. (A declaration may also re-introduce a name into a translation unit.)

A **definition** is a declaration that fully defines the entity being introduced.

A variable is an entity introduced by the declaration of an object (or of a reference other than a non-static data member)

Declarations that are not definitions:

- `extern`
- `typedef`
- `using`

**Linkage**: C++ allows certain declarations of an entity to occur more than once in the same program, translation unit, or scope.

- External linkage: from scopes of other translation units or from other scopes of the same translation units.
- Internal linkage: from scopes in the same translation unit.
- No linkage.

### The One-Definition Rule

A given program must contain exactly one definition of every non-inline variable or function that is used in the program.

For an inline variable or an inline function, a definition is required in every translation unit that uses it.

Exactly one definition of a class must appear in any translation unit that uses it in such a way that the class must be complete.


### Storage Duration and Objects

- **automatic** storage duration, applies to all local objects except `thread_local`, `static`, `extern`.
- **dynamic** storage duration, allocated and deallocated by the program using functions that perform dynamic memory allocation. Created using `new` , deleted using `delete`.
- **static** storage duration, allocated at the beginning of the program and deallocated at the end of the program.
  - declared at namespace scope, including the global namespace.
  - `static` or `extern`.

### ABI and Name-Mangling

ABI: application binary interface.

Needed for compatibility with C.

### Linking, Loading

**Linking**: final stage of compilation.

- Determines a set of all symbols.
- Resolves references to internal and external symbols.
- Assign addresses to symbols.
- Revises code and data to reflect the addresses.
- Emit executable code.

**Loading**: OS loader validates the executable image file. Loads and runs the image. Program, data are initialized.
