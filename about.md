Hi there, my name is 魏炜 (WEI WEI).

I'm a Master student at [Stanford CS](http://cs.stanford.edu) with a focus on
Information Management and Analysis.

I graduated from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn). I did research with
Advanced Networking Lab where I published two paper in the field of
cloud computing.

I believe in persistence, passion, and simplicity.

I'm a big fan of [Github](https://github.com/wweiw) and you can find most of all
my projects there. At my spare time, I would implement classic algorithms
and learn how they work.
